# PTP button on other film sites
A userscript to add a button linking to a film's PTP page from other popular film websites. The link will go directly to the film's page where possible (if an IMDb ID is provided), or will otherwise link to the search results for the film's title and year, allowing you to quickly get to what you're after.

### Supported websites
This script will add a PTP button to: [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), [IMDb](https://imdb.com), [TheMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org), and [Trakt](https://trakt.tv).

### Installation
You'll need a userscript manager installed in your browser. I personally use Tampermonkey, but others like Greasemonkey and Violentmonkey are also available.

Option 1: Install via [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/452640-ptp-button-on-other-film-sites).

Option 2: If you don't wish to use GreasyFork, simply view the [.user.js file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjp/ptpBtnOnFilmSites/master/PTP%20button%20on%20other%20film%20sites.user.js) in your browser. Your userscript manager should prompt you to install it, if not you can copy and paste the contents of the file into a new script and save it. Do note that repository URLs and file/directory names may change in the future, so installing from GreasyFork should be the preferred method.

### Screenshots
Here are some screenshots with a useless red rectangle showing where you can expect to find the PTP button on each of the supported websites:
