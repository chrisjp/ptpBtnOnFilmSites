# PTP Button on Letterboxd
Userscript to add a button on Letterboxd film pages linking to the film's PTP page.

### Installation
Most popular userscript managers such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey will prompt you to install simply by viewing the [.user.js file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjp/ptpBtnOnLB/master/PTP%20Button%20on%20Letterboxd.user.js) in your browser. If not, add a new script in your userscript manager and paste the contents of the file and save it.
